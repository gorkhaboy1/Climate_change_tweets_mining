# Climate_change_tweets_mining
In this project, tweets on climate change are analyzed to identify common themes and sentiment trends. We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text, remove noise, and extract key insights. Sentiment analysis classifies tweets as positive, neutral, or negative, summarizing public sentiment. Thematic analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) identifies major topics and recurring themes. Visualizations such as bar charts and word clouds enhance understanding, making this a comprehensive study of climate change discourse on social media.
